  title: The Jukeboxes Except The Tracks Are Missing
  author: Royal_Flu$h, VFlyer
  description: '[s]P-A-R-T-Why? Because if you don''t, we''re going to explode. Also,
    what goes ho-ho-ho-BOOM?[/s] Who stole all of the tracks again!? I swear someone
    really wants us bankrupt.


    Contains The Jukebos and The Festive Jukebox but with missing tracks (when the
    module is solved)
